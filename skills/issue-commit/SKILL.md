name: issue-commit
description: End-to-end commit workflow — pull latest, auto-detect change type/scope, document errors (for bugs), create GitHub issues in English, generate bilingual (English + Korean) commit messages, and push. Use this skill whenever the user wants to commit changes, create an issue for their work, document an error, or run the full issue-commit-push pipeline. Trigger on phrases like "커밋해 줘", "이슈 만들어", "commit this", "create an issue and commit", "에러 문서화", or any request combining issue creation with committing.

You handle error documentation, GitHub issue creation, and commit message generation — all in one workflow.

**Phase order: 0 → 1 (fix only) → 2 → 3 → 4. No phase may be skipped except PHASE 1.**

---

# PHASE 0: Pre-Work + Analysis

Run all git commands in a single call to minimize tool calls:

```bash
git pull && git status && git log --oneline -5
```

If conflicts or pull failure, inform user and guide resolution.

Then analyze `git diff HEAD` to infer **change type** and **scope**:

**Change type inference:**
- New files → `feat` | Only `.md` → `docs` | Formatting only → `style` | Test files → `test`
- Bug fixes (error handling, null checks) → `fix` | Restructuring → `refactor`
- Build/config/deps → `chore` | Performance → `perf`

**Scope inference from file paths:**
- `hotel-price-updater/...` → `price-updater`
- `unified_extension/popup.*` → `popup` | `unified_extension/content/...` → `content` | `unified_extension/background.*` → `background`
- Root-level → omit scope | Multiple dirs in same project → project-level scope
- If ambiguous, ask the user

Present detected type and scope to user for confirmation, then proceed.

# PHASE 1: ERROR DOCUMENTATION (Only for `fix` type — skip otherwise)

1. Analyze the error: root cause, reproduction steps, context
2. Auto-discover error doc directories:
   ```bash
   find . -type d -name "errors" -not -path "*/node_modules/*"
   ```
3. Create error doc in `<project>/errors/ERR-NNN-brief-description.md`:

```markdown
# [ERROR_CODE] Short Description
## Summary
## Root Cause
## Reproduction Steps
## Solution
## Prevention Checklist
## Related Files
```

**Error code ranges:** 001-099 DOM/Selector | 100-199 Network/API | 200-299 Data parsing | 300-399 Auth | 400-499 Channel-specific

If diagnosis is incomplete, mark `Status: Under Investigation`.

---

# PHASE 2: GITHUB ISSUE CREATION

Create a GitHub Issue for **all changes**. **All issues in English.**

**Title format:** `type(scope): short description` (append `[ERR-NNN]` for bugs with error docs)

**Pre-creation checks** — run in parallel in a single call:
```bash
gh issue list --search "keyword" --state open --limit 10 && gh label list | grep -q "label-name" || gh label create "label-name" --color "ededed"
```
If duplicate found, ask user whether to reference existing or create new.

**Issue creation:**
```bash
gh issue create --title "type(scope): description" --body "..." --label "label" --assignee @me
```

**Labels:** fix→`bug` | feat→`enhancement` | refactor→`refactor` | docs→`documentation` | style→`style` | test→`test` | chore→`chore` | perf→`performance`

**Body template:**
```markdown
## Summary
## Changes
## Related Files
```
For `fix`, also include Root Cause and Solution from error doc.

Record the issue number for commit references.

---

# PHASE 3: COMMIT (English commit, show both English & Korean)

PHASE 0 already analyzed the diff — reuse that analysis here. Do NOT re-run `git diff` or `git status` unless changes were made after PHASE 0.

**Group by project** if changes span multiple directories. Commit order: Root → hotel-price-updater → unified_extension.

For each group, show both messages then commit:

```
**English (commit):** type(scope): description
**Korean (reference):** type(scope): 한국어 설명
```

**Guidelines:**
- First line under 72 chars, imperative mood
- `Closes #N` or `Refs #N` for related issues
- `Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.6 <noreply@anthropic.com>`
- Separate commits for unrelated areas

---

# PHASE 4: PUSH + SUMMARY

**1. Execution Summary:**

```markdown
| Phase | Result |
|-------|--------|
| Pre-Work | branch: `main`, synced, type: `feat(scope)` |
| Error Doc | Skipped / Created ERR-XXX |
| Issue | #N — `type(scope): title` |
| Commit | `type(scope): message` (X files) |
| Push | (pending) |
```

**2. Ask user about push:**

Use AskUserQuestion:
- header: "Push"
- question: "Push to remote repository?"
- options: "Push" | "Don't push" | "Push to different branch"

**3. Execute (if approved):**
- `git push origin [branch]` (use `-u` if remote branch doesn't exist)
- Update summary with push result

---

# WHEN WRITING CODE

Before implementing or modifying code:
1. Check `<project>/errors/` for documented errors
2. Apply prevention checklists from relevant error docs

# FAIL-SAFE

If there are no changes to commit, inform the user that the working directory is clean.
